Here are the **details and tricky parts** for each point mentioned, which will help you cover them with a deeper understanding:

---

### **1. Introduction to Spring Framework**
#### **Details**:
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Explain how DI eliminates tight coupling between classes and allows for better testability and maintainability.
- **Bean Lifecycle**:
  - Explain the lifecycle: instantiation, property setting, initialization (post-initialization), and destruction.
  - Use examples with `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`.
- **Spring AOP**:
  - Use cases: logging, transaction management, security.
  - Explain cross-cutting concerns and how they’re separated.

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Circular dependencies when using constructor injection.
- Deciding when to use setter vs constructor injection.
- AOP pitfalls, such as proxy creation issues when methods call each other internally.

---

### **2. Spring Boot**
#### **Details**:
- **Auto-Configuration**:
  - How Spring Boot scans classpath and enables configurations using `@Conditional` annotations.
- **Embedded Servers**:
  - Differences between Tomcat and Jetty (performance, use cases).
  - Modifying server properties (e.g., changing the port, enabling HTTPS).

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Dealing with classpath conflicts when using multiple starters.
- Customizing auto-configuration without overriding defaults.

---

### **3. Dependency Injection in Detail**
#### **Details**:
- **@Autowired Pitfalls**:
  - Ambiguity with multiple beans; resolve using `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`.
- **@Profile**:
  - Use a live demo to show environment-based beans (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).
- **Field Injection**:
  - Explain why it’s discouraged (difficult to test).

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Lazy vs eager initialization of beans.
- Proxy beans and circular dependencies in complex configurations.

---

### **4. Configuration in Spring and Spring Boot**
#### **Details**:
- **Externalized Configuration**:
  - Demonstrate loading properties dynamically based on `spring.profiles.active`.
- **Property Binding**:
  - Using `@ConfigurationProperties` vs `@Value`.
- **Custom Property Sources**:
  - Loading properties from files outside the application JAR.

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Resolving property precedence when using multiple sources.
- Binding nested properties incorrectly (complex objects).

---

### **5. Rest API Development**
#### **Details**:
- **Validation**:
  - Use `@Valid` for DTO validation and demonstrate how `@ControllerAdvice` can customize error responses.
- **Request Mapping**:
  - Explain path variable vs request parameter usage with examples.
- **Global Exception Handling**:
  - Implement centralized exception handling using `@RestControllerAdvice`.

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Handling circular dependencies between DTOs and entities.
- Versioning REST APIs gracefully (URI-based vs Header-based).

---

### **6. Spring Boot with Databases**
#### **Details**:
- **Spring Data JPA**:
  - Custom queries using JPQL and native SQL.
  - Use `@EntityGraph` to avoid N+1 queries.
- **Database Migrations**:
  - Flyway: Explain why migrations are important in CI/CD pipelines.
  - Liquibase: Demonstrate rollback scenarios.

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Handling lazy initialization exceptions in JPA.
- Query optimization with joins and indexing strategies.

---

### **7. Security in Spring and Spring Boot**
#### **Details**:
- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Difference between session-based and token-based security.
  - Securing specific endpoints using `@PreAuthorize` and `@PostAuthorize`.
- **JWT Integration**:
  - Demonstrate token generation and validation, including expiration handling.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Use `@Secured` and `@RolesAllowed` for role-specific access.

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues with frontend-backend communication.
- Token revocation strategies (maintaining blacklist or token expiration).

---

### **8. Microservices with Spring Boot**
#### **Details**:
- **Service Discovery**:
  - Explain how Eureka handles service registry and heartbeat mechanisms.
- **Resilience Patterns**:
  - Use Resilience4j for rate-limiting and fallback mechanisms.
- **Centralized Configuration**:
  - Spring Cloud Config to manage properties across services.

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Managing consistent property updates across microservices.
- Synchronizing service instances in dynamic scaling scenarios.

---

### **9. Advanced Topics**
#### **Details**:
- **Actuator**:
  - Expose custom health indicators and metrics.
  - Secure actuator endpoints in production environments.
- **Testing**:
  - MockMVC to test controllers without a server.
  - Writing integration tests with `@SpringBootTest` and Testcontainers.

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Mocking beans with complex dependencies.
- Dealing with database state in integration tests.

---

### **10. Best Practices and Real-World Applications**
#### **Details**:
- **Code Structure**:
  - Layered architecture: controller, service, repository layers.
- **Monitoring and Observability**:
  - Use Micrometer with Prometheus/Grafana for metrics visualization.
- **Scaling**:
  - Horizontal scaling with stateless services using Kubernetes.

#### **Tricky Parts**:
- Managing consistency with distributed caching solutions.
- Debugging performance issues in scaled applications.
